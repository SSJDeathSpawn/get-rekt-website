# Tasks

## Registration Number Validation

1. Check whether registration number is valid.
2. Check whether registration number is present in the list of TAG members.

## User system (Optional) 

1. To avoid spam, create a user system so that people have to sign up before registering for tournament
2. Allow only one team registration per user (automatically will become team leader)

### Create superuser view

1. So the Tag Core members can see all the registrations, we need a seperate viewing page for them
